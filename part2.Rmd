1.	A useful descriptive introductory summary (3 - 4 sentences) of whatâ€™s contained in the project
2.	Image(s), with captions and necessary citation(s), of Bonneville Dam and/or steelhead (or whatever time series data you choose to explore)
3.	All of your organized and well-annotated code (with warnings/messages hidden) used to create at least:

-	A finalized time series plot of the original observations (daily data)
-	A finalized seasonplot to explore if/how monthly passage has shifted over time (I totaled counts by month before doing this...you can choose if you want to do that)
-	A finalized visualization of annual steelhead passage counts 

4.	Make sure that your figures appear in your final knitted document, each with a useful caption. Include text associated with each to help the audience understand and interpret the results.
